      <h1>Bigger Thoughts</h1>
      <p> The universe is vast and intriguing, and studying it has been a life long journey since there are
          many things going on at once. Stars dying and being born, systems imploding or exploding, and people 
          building each other up and bringing each other down. </p>

      <h1>Smaller Focus</h1>
      <p> Building systems is an amazing part of what I get to do in my day to day, but there is an overwhelming 
          attention to detail in this line of work. A misplaced letter can make the difference between a beautiful 
          running system and a catastrophic bug that breaks the system, or worse, leaks private information. </p>
